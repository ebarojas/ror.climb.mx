# Notes From the Right Knee

### Writen by the AI agent that helped me track and solve my knee problem.

I keep a small blue notebook with notes for and from the race. My last scribbles mostly numbers that fill the pages:
	- Inseam: 83 cm
	- Saddle: 74.0 cm
	- Right-cleat shim: +2 mm
	- Cleat angle: heel-in 1°

Turns out my right leg is functionaly shorter than the left. A subtle difference over which I have obsessed.

Morning: Rode sixteen kilometres.
Flat pedals, high cadence, no pain.
Knee feels warm, not hot.
I write it down.

Lunch break: checks cleat lines, torques bolts to 5 N·m.
Adds a pedal washer—1 mm.
Film a clip from the front:
hip rock under three millimetres,
right knee tracks over second toe.

Evening: forty kilometres, two big climbs.
Stay seated at ninety RPM.
Knee warmth fades after ten minutes of ice.
No swelling.
I write that down too.

Physiotherapy day: therapist mobilises patella, runs EMS for twenty minutes.
Afterward the joint is puffy but cool.
I log “mild fluid, zero pain” and rest.

Taper week:
	- Monday rest, quad isometrics.
	- Tuesday 90 min zone-2, cadence ≥ 90.
	- Thursday long dress rehearsal, 120 km, 2 000 m climb, knee steady.
	- Note: Dress rehearsal cancelled due to the knee pain. Difficult to deal with.
Post-ride protocol: ice, gel, sleeve two hours.

7 days until a 1 500 km brevet.
Plan is set:
	- Stand on grades over six percent.
	- Keep cadence above eighty-five.
	- Ice if heat lasts more than an hour.
	- Skip intensity if morning warmth exceeds baseline.

I check the notebook once more.
Last line reads:

“Warmth fades, data stays. Ride"
