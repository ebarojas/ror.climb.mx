# LEL ... finally

Today I'm flying to the UK to participate in the London Edinburgh London 1500km Audax event. It has been a very bumpy ride, these last weeks. I developed a knee injury where it was revealed to me that I actually have a functionally shorter leg on the bike - in reality my right foot it 9mm shorter than the left, but because we ride with the ball of our feet, my right leg has shorter reach and is therefore functionally shorter. I also found out that I had significant bike fit issues, some of the related to the foot assymetry, but others just related to my own ignorance. I feel like I've done surprisingly low planning for this event, especially considering how much of an overthinker I am.

In any case, the event will start in a bit less than a week - and whether or not my knee will be up to challenge is anyones guess. I will do my best, and deal with problems as they come up.

Everardo
