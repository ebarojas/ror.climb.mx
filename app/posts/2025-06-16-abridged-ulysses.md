## Chapter 1 - Telemachus

**Setting:** Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned.

**Dialogue:**

- Buck Mulligan: "Introibo ad altare Dei."
- Buck Mulligan: "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Back to barracks!"
- Buck Mulligan: "For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all."
- Buck Mulligan: "Thanks, old chap. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?"
- Buck Mulligan: "The mockery of it! Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!"
- Buck Mulligan: "My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Will he come? The jejune jesuit!"
- Stephen: "Tell me, Mulligan, how long is Haines going to stay in this tower?"
- Buck Mulligan: "God, isn't he dreadful? A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade."
- Stephen: "He was raving all night about a black panther. Where is his guncase?"
- Buck Mulligan: "A woful lunatic! Were you in a funk?"
- Stephen: "I was, out here in the dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off."
- Buck Mulligan: "The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't let me have anything to do with you."
- Stephen: "Someone killed her."
- Buck Mulligan: "You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you..."
- Stephen: "I am not thinking of the offence to my mother."
- Buck Mulligan: "Of what then?"
- Stephen: "Of the offence to me."
- Buck Mulligan: "O, an impossible person!"
- Haines: "Are you up there, Mulligan?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm coming."
- Buck Mulligan: "Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers."
- Buck Mulligan: "Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding."
- Buck Mulligan: "Kinch ahoy!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines apologises for waking us. He said goodbye."
- Stephen: "I'm coming."
- Buck Mulligan: "Do, for Jesus' sake, for my sake and for all our sakes."
- Buck Mulligan: "I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean."
- Stephen: "I get paid this morning."
- Buck Mulligan: "The school kip? How much? Four quid? Lend us one."
- Stephen: "If you want it."
- Buck Mulligan: "Four shining sovereigns, we'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids."
- Buck Mulligan: "We'll be choked. Haines, open that door, will you?"
- Haines: "Have you the key?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Dedalus has it. Janey Mack, I'm choked!"
- Stephen: "It's in the lock."
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm melting, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject!"
- Buck Mulligan: "What sort of a kip is this? I told her to come after eight."
- Stephen: "We can drink it black, there's a lemon in the locker."
- Buck Mulligan: "O, damn you and your Paris fads! I want Sandycove milk."
- Buck Mulligan: "That woman is coming up with the milk."
- Buck Mulligan: "The blessings of God on you! In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm giving you two lumps each. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don't you?"
- Buck Mulligan: "When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water."
- Haines: "By Jove, it is tea."
- Buck Mulligan: "So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma'am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don't make them in the one pot."
- Buck Mulligan: "That's folk, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind."
- Stephen: "Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?"
- Stephen: "I doubt it."
- Buck Mulligan: "Do you now? Your reasons, pray?"
- Stephen: "I fancy, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion."
- Buck Mulligan: "Charming! showing his white teeth and thumbing his lip. The quaint name of the quaint old lady. It's like a name out of Ibsen. I suppose she was a Yiddisher."
- Old woman: "The milk, sir!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Come in, ma'am. Kinch, get the jug."
- Old woman: "That's a lovely morning, sir. Glory be to God."
- Buck Mulligan: "To whom? Ah, to be sure!"
- Buck Mulligan: "The islanders speak frequently of the beast by that name, Stephen said to Haines casually."
- Old woman: "How much, sir?"
- Stephen: "A quart."
- Buck Mulligan: "It is indeed, ma'am, pouring milk into their cups."
- Old woman: "Taste it, sir."
- Buck Mulligan: "If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits."
- Old woman: "Are you a medical student, sir?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I am, ma'am."
- Old woman: "Look at that now."
- Stephen: "Do you understand what he says?"
- Old woman: "Is it French you are talking, sir?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Irish. Is there Gaelic on you?"
- Old woman: "I thought it was Irish, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?"
- Haines: "I am an Englishman."
- Buck Mulligan: "He's English, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland."
- Old woman: "Sure we ought to, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows."
- Buck Mulligan: "Grand is no name for it. Wonderful entirely. Fill out the place for the tea."
- Old woman: "No, thank you, sir, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go."
- Haines: "Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?"
- Old woman: "Bill, sir? Well, it's seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings every other day at twopence is three twos is sixpence and one and two is two and two, sir."
- Haines: "Pay up and look pleasant, smiling."
- Buck Mulligan: "A miracle! Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give."
- Buck Mulligan: "We'll owe twopence."
- Old woman: "Time enough, sir, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir."
- Buck Mulligan: "Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty."
- Haines: "That reminds me, rising, that I have to visit your national library today."
- Buck Mulligan: "Our swim first."
- Buck Mulligan: "Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?"
- Buck Mulligan: "The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month."
- Stephen: "All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf."
- Haines: "I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me."
- Haines: "That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good."
- Buck Mulligan: "Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines."
- Haines: "Well, I mean it, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in."
- Stephen: "Would I make any money by it?"
- Haines: "I don't know, I'm sure."
- Buck Mulligan: "You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?"
- Stephen: "Well? The problem is to get money. From whom? From the queen or from her successor?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I blow him out about you, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes."
- Stephen: "I see little hope, from her or from him."
- Buck Mulligan: "From me, Kinch."
- Buck Mulligan: "To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don't you play them as I do?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Mulligan is stripped of his garments."
- Buck Mulligan: "There's your snotrag."
- Buck Mulligan: "And there's your Latin quarter hat."
- Haines: "Are you coming, you fellows?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm ready. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose."
- Buck Mulligan: "Did you bring the key?"
- Stephen: "I have it, preceding them."
- Buck Mulligan: "Down, sir! How dare you, sir!"
- Haines: "Do you pay rent for this tower?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Twelve quid."
- Stephen: "To the secretary of state for war, over his shoulder."
- Haines: "Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Billy Pitt had them built when the French were on the sea. But ours is the omphalos."
- Haines: "What is your idea of Hamlet?"
- Buck Mulligan: "No, no, I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first."
- Buck Mulligan: "You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?"
- Stephen: "It has waited so long, it can wait longer."
- Haines: "You pique my curiosity. Is it some paradox?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Pooh! We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father."
- Haines: "What? beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?"
- Buck Mulligan: "O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!"
- Stephen: "We're always tired in the morning, to Haines. And it is rather long to tell."
- Buck Mulligan: "The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus."
- Haines: "I mean to say, explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o'er his base into the sea, isn't it?"
- Haines: "It's a wonderful tale, bringing them to halt again."
- Stephen: "I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father."
- Buck Mulligan: "We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn't it?"
- Stephen: "The ballad of joking Jesus."
- Haines: "O, you have heard it before?"
- Stephen: "Three times a day, after meals."
- Haines: "You're not a believer, are you? I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God."
- Stephen: "There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me."
- Haines: "Thank you, taking a cigarette."
- Haines: "Yes, of course, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a personal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?"
- Stephen: "You behold in me, with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought."
- Haines: "After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me."
- Stephen: "I am a servant of two masters, an English and an Italian."
- Haines: "Italian?"
- Stephen: "And a third, there is who wants me for odd jobs."
- Haines: "Italian? What do you mean?"
- Stephen: "The imperial British state, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church."
- Haines: "I can quite understand that, calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame."
- Haines: "Of course I'm a Britisher, and I feel as one. I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now."
- Buck Mulligan: "She's making for Bullock harbour."
- Buck Mulligan: "There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today."
- Buck Mulligan: "Is the brother with you, Malachi?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons."
- Buck Mulligan: "Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her."
- Buck Mulligan: "Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure."
- Buck Mulligan: "Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. He's on the loose. What did you do with the lovelorn letters when the banns broke?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Ah, go to God!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Yes."
- Buck Mulligan: "Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money."
- Buck Mulligan: "Is she up the pole?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Better ask Seymour that."
- Buck Mulligan: "Seymour a bleeding officer!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Redheaded women buck like goats."
- Buck Mulligan: "My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the Übermensch. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen."
- Haines: "Are you going in here, Malachi?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Yes. Make room in the bed."
- Buck Mulligan: "Are you not coming in?"
- Haines: "Later on. Not on my breakfast."
- Stephen: "I'm going, Mulligan."
- Buck Mulligan: "Give us that key, Kinch, to keep my chemise flat."
- Buck Mulligan: "And twopence, for a pint. Throw it there."
- Buck Mulligan: "He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra."
- Haines: "We'll see you again, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish."
- Buck Mulligan: "The Ship, half twelve."
- Stephen: "Good."

## Chapter 2 - Nestor

**Setting:** A classroom where Stephen teaches his students about history. The boy's blank face asked the blank window. Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.

**Dialogue:**

- Stephen: "You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?"
- Cochrane: "Tarentum, sir."
- Stephen: "Very good. Well?"
- Student: "There was a battle, sir."
- Stephen: "Very good. Where?"
- Student: "I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C."
- Stephen: "Asculum, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book."
- Student: "Yes, sir. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for."
- Stephen: "You, Armstrong. What was the end of Pyrrhus?"
- Armstrong: "End of Pyrrhus, sir?"
- Comyn: "I know, sir. Ask me, sir."
- Stephen: "Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?"
- Armstrong: "Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier."
- Stephen: "Tell me now, poking the boy's shoulder with the book, what is a pier."
- Armstrong: "A pier, sir. A thing out in the water. A kind of a bridge."
- Stephen: "Kingstown pier. Yes, a disappointed bridge."
- Comyn: "How, sir? A bridge is across a river."
- Student: "Tell us a story, sir."
- Student: "O, do, sir. A ghoststory."
- Stephen: "Where do you begin in this? opening another book."
- Comyn: "Weep no more."
- Stephen: "Go on then, Talbot."
- Student: "And the story, sir?"
- Stephen: "After. Go on, Talbot."
- Stephen: "Turn over, quietly. I don't see anything."
- Talbot: "What, sir? simply, bending forward."
- Stephen: "Have I heard all?"
- Student: "Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir."
- Student: "Half day, sir. Thursday."
- Stephen: "Who can answer a riddle?"
- Student: "A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir."
- Student: "O, ask me, sir."
- Student: "A hard one, sir."
- Stephen: "This is the riddle: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven."
- Student: "What, sir?"
- Student: "Again, sir. We didn't hear."
- Stephen: "What is it? We give it up."
- Stephen: "The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush."
- Students: "Hockey!"
- Sargent: "Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, and show them to you, sir."
- Stephen: "Do you understand how to do them now?"
- Sargent: "Numbers eleven to fifteen. Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir."
- Stephen: "Can you do them yourself?"
- Sargent: "No, sir."
- Stephen: "Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?"
- Sargent: "Yes, sir."
- Stephen: "It is very simple, as he stood up."
- Sargent: "Yes, sir. Thanks."
- Stephen: "You had better get your stick and go out to the others, as they are finished for the day."
- Sargent: "Yes, sir."
- Stephen: "Sargent!"
- Stephen: "Run on. Mr Deasy is calling you."
- Mr. Deasy: "What is it now? continually without listening."
- Stephen: "Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir."
- Mr. Deasy: "Will you wait in my study for a moment, till I restore order here."
- Mr. Deasy: "What is the matter? What is it now?"
- Mr. Deasy: "First, our little financial settlement."
- Mr. Deasy: "Two, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away."
- Mr. Deasy: "Three, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand."
- Mr. Deasy: "Three twelve. I think you'll find that's right."
- Stephen: "Thank you, sir, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers."
- Mr. Deasy: "No thanks at all. You have earned it."
- Stephen: "I owe thanks."
- Mr. Deasy: "Don't carry it like that. You'll pull it out somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very handy."
- Stephen: "Mine would be often empty."
- Mr. Deasy: "Because you don't save, pointing his finger. You don't know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? Put but money in thy purse."
- Stephen: "Iago."
- Mr. Deasy: "He knew what money was. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English?"
- Stephen: "That on his empire the sun never sets."
- Mr. Deasy: "Ba! That's not English. A French Celt said that. He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail."
- Mr. Deasy: "I will tell you, solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid my way."
- Stephen: "Good man, good man."
- Mr. Deasy: "I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel that? I owe nothing. Can you?"
- Stephen: "For the moment, no."
- Mr. Deasy: "I knew you couldn't, joyously. But one day you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also be just."
- Stephen: "I fear those big words, which make us so unhappy."
- Mr. Deasy: "You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine in '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things."
- Stephen: "To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher."
- Mr. Deasy: "I have rebel blood in me too. On the spindle side. But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all Irish, all kings' sons."
- Stephen: "Alas."
- Mr. Deasy: "Per vias rectas, was his motto. He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do it."
- Stephen: "Lal the ral the ra, The rocky road to Dublin."
- Mr. Deasy: "That reminds me. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here."
- Mr. Deasy: "Sit down. Excuse me, over his shoulder, the dictates of common sense. Just a moment."
- Mr. Deasy: "Full stop, to his keys. But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question..."
- Mr. Deasy: "Now then, rising."
- Mr. Deasy: "I have put the matter into a nutshell. It's about the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions on the matter."
- Mr. Deasy: "I don't mince words, do I? as Stephen read on."
- Mr. Deasy: "I want that to be printed and read. You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by..."
- Mr. Deasy: "Mark my words, Mr Dedalus. England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying."
- Mr. Deasy: "Dying, again, if not dead by now."
- Stephen: "A merchant, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?"
- Mr. Deasy: "They sinned against the light, gravely. And you can see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day."
- Stephen: "Who has not?"
- Mr. Deasy: "What do you mean?"
- Stephen: "History, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."
- Mr. Deasy: "The ways of the Creator are not our ways. All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God."
- Stephen: "That is God."
- Mr. Deasy: "What?"
- Stephen: "A shout in the street, shrugging his shoulders."
- Mr. Deasy: "Very good then."
- Mr. Deasy: "I am happier than you are. We have committed many errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end."
- Student: "Well, sir."
- Mr. Deasy: "I foresee, that you will not remain here very long at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong."
- Stephen: "A learner rather."
- Mr. Deasy: "Who knows? To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher."
- Mr. Deasy: "As regards these."
- Mr. Deasy: "Yes. You have two copies there. If you can have them published. I have never asked a personal favour before, never. Could you try?"
- Stephen: "I will try, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly."
- Mr. Deasy: "That will do, briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M. P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?"
- Stephen: "The Evening Telegraph..."
- Mr. Deasy: "That will do. There is no time to lose. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin."
- Stephen: "Good morning, sir, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you."
- Mr. Deasy: "Not at all, as he searched the papers on his desk. I like to break a lance with you, old as I am."
- Stephen: "Good morning, sir, again, bowing to his bent back."
- Mr. Deasy: "Mr Dedalus!"
- Mr. Deasy: "Just one moment."
- Stephen: "Yes, sir, turning back at the gate."
- Mr. Deasy: "I just wanted to say. Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And do you know why?"
- Stephen: "Why, sir? beginning to smile."
- Mr. Deasy: "Because she never let them in, solemnly."
- Mr. Deasy: "She never let them in, again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why."

## Chapter 3 - Proteus

**Setting:** Sandymount strand. Stephen walks along the beach, thinking philosophical thoughts. "Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot."

**Dialogue:**

- Voice: "It's Stephen, sir."
- Voice: "Let him in. Let Stephen in."
- Voice: "We thought you were someone else."
- Uncle Richie: "Morrow, nephew."
- Stephen: "Yes, sir?"
- Uncle Richie: "Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?"
- Voice: "Bathing Crissie, sir."
- Stephen: "No, uncle Richie..."
- Uncle Richie: "Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!"
- Stephen: "Uncle Richie, really..."
- Uncle Richie: "Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down."
- Voice: "He has nothing to sit down on, sir."
- Uncle Richie: "He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair."
- Telegram: "Mother dying come home father."
- Voice: "Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!"

## Chapter 4 - Calypso

**Setting:** Leopold Bloom's house at 7 Eccles Street in the morning. Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.

**Dialogue:**

- Cat: "Mkgnao!"
- Bloom: "O, there you are, turning from the fire."
- Bloom: "Milk for the pussens."
- Cat: "Mrkgnao!"
- Bloom: "Afraid of the chickens she is, mockingly. Afraid of the chickens."
- Cat: "Mrkrgnao!"
- Cat: "Gurrhr! running to lap."
- Bloom: "I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute."
- Bloom: "You don't want anything for breakfast?"
- Molly: "Mn."
- Bloom: "Good day, Mr O'Rourke."
- Mr O'Rourke: "Good day to you."
- Bloom: "Lovely weather, sir."
- Mr O'Rourke: "'Tis all that."
- Butcher: "Now, my miss."
- Butcher: "Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, my miss."
- Butcher: "Threepence, please."
- Butcher: "Thank you, sir. Another time."
- Bloom: "Good morning, moving away."
- Butcher: "Good morning, sir."
- Molly: "Poldy!"
- Molly: "Who are the letters for?"
- Bloom: "A letter for me from Milly, carefully, and a card to you. And a letter for you."
- Molly: "Do you want the blind up?"
- Bloom: "That do? turning."
- Molly: "She got the things."
- Molly: "Hurry up with that tea. I'm parched."
- Bloom: "The kettle is boiling."
- Molly: "Poldy!"
- Bloom: "What?"
- Molly: "Scald the teapot."
- Molly: "What a time you were!"
- Bloom: "Who was the letter from?"
- Molly: "O, Boylan. He's bringing the programme."
- Bloom: "What are you singing?"
- Molly: "Là ci darem with J. C. Doyle, and Love's Old Sweet Song."
- Bloom: "Would you like the window open a little?"
- Molly: "What time is the funeral?"
- Bloom: "Eleven, I think. I didn't see the paper."
- Molly: "No: that book."
- Molly: "It must have fell down."
- Molly: "Show here. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to ask you."
- Bloom: "Met him what?"
- Molly: "Here. What does that mean?"
- Bloom: "Metempsychosis?"
- Molly: "Yes. Who's he when he's at home?"
- Bloom: "Metempsychosis, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls."
- Molly: "O, rocks! Tell us in plain words."
- Bloom: "Did you finish it?"
- Molly: "Yes. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?"
- Bloom: "Never read it. Do you want another?"
- Molly: "Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has."
- Bloom: "Some people believe, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or on some other planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives."
- Bloom: "Metempsychosis, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They used to believe you could be changed into a tree for example. Or into a hawk, a cat. Or even a stone. How they used to believe that."
- Molly: "There's a smell of burn. Did you leave anything on the fire?"
- Bloom: "The kidney! suddenly."
- Bloom: "Miaow! in answer. Wait till I'm ready."
- Bloom: "Come, come, pussy. Come."

## Chapter 5 - Lotus Eaters

**Setting:** Bloom's morning wanderings through Dublin streets.

**Dialogue:**

- Bloom: "Are there any letters for me?"
- M'Coy: "Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?"
- Bloom: "Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular."
- M'Coy: "How's the body?"
- Bloom: "Fine. How are you?"
- M'Coy: "Just keeping alive."
- M'Coy: "Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're..."
- Bloom: "O, no. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today."
- M'Coy: "To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?"
- Bloom: "E...eleven."
- M'Coy: "I must try to get out there. Eleven, is it? I only heard it this morning."
- Bloom: "I know."
- M'Coy: "I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do you think he told me?"
- M'Coy: "And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? I said."
- M'Coy: "Why? I said. What's wrong with him? I said."
- Bloom: "Yes."
- M'Coy: "What's wrong with him? He said. He's dead, he said. And, faith, he was right."
- Bloom: "Yes, yes, after a dull sigh. Another gone."
- M'Coy: "One of the best."
- M'Coy: "Wife well, I suppose?"
- Bloom: "O, yes. Tiptop, thanks."
- M'Coy: "My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet."
- Bloom: "My wife too. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth."
- M'Coy: "That so? Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?"
- Bloom: "It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, thoughtfully."
- M'Coy: "O, well. That's good news."
- M'Coy: "Well, glad to see you looking fit. Meet you knocking around."
- Bloom: "Yes."
- M'Coy: "Tell you what. You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. You just put down my name at the funeral."
- Bloom: "I'll do that, moving to get off. That'll be all right."
- M'Coy: "Right, brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly could. Well, so long."
- Bloom: "That will be done, firmly."
- Voice: "O God, our refuge and our strength..."
- Voice: "Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil..."
- Chemist: "About a fortnight ago, sir?"
- Bloom: "Yes."
- Bloom: "Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, and then I want a flannel bandage."
- Chemist: "And white wax also."
- Chemist: "Yes, sir. That was two and nine. Have you brought a bottle?"
- Bloom: "No. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and take it away."
- Chemist: "Fourpence, sir."
- Bloom: "I'll take this one. That makes three and a penny."
- Chemist: "Yes, sir. You can pay all together, sir, when you call."
- Bloom: "Good."
- Bantam Lyons: "Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute."
- Bantam Lyons: "I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam Lyons said."
- Bloom: "You can keep it."
- Bantam Lyons: "Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the second."
- Bloom: "I was just going to throw it away."
- Bantam Lyons: "What's that? his sharp voice said."
- Bloom: "I say you can keep it. I was going to throw it away anyway."
- Bantam Lyons: "I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks."

## Chapter 6 - Hades

**Setting:** The funeral carriage ride to Glasnevin Cemetery for Paddy Dignam's burial.

**Dialogue:**

- Dedalus: "Come on, Simon."
- Bloom: "After you."
- Dedalus: "Yes, yes."
- Martin Cunningham: "Are we all here now? Come along, Bloom."
- Power: "What way is he taking us?"
- Martin Cunningham: "Irishtown. Ringsend. Brunswick street."
- Power: "That's a fine old custom. I am glad to see it has not died out."
- Martin Cunningham: "There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus."
- Dedalus: "Who is that?"
- Martin Cunningham: "Your son and heir."
- Dedalus: "Where is he? stretching over across."
- Dedalus: "Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!"
- Bloom: "No. He was alone."
- Dedalus: "Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, the Goulding connection."
- Dedalus: "He's in with a lowdown crowd. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts."
- Dedalus: "I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's."
- Power: "Are we late?"
- Martin Cunningham: "Ten minutes, looking at his watch."
- Power: "Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke."
- Dedalus: "He might, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?"
- Dedalus: "What is this, in the name of God? Crumbs?"
- Power: "Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately."
- Power: "Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?"
- Martin Cunningham: "It struck me too."
- Power: "After all, it's the most natural thing in the world."
- Martin Cunningham: "Did Tom Kernan turn up? twirling the peak of his beard."
- Bloom: "Yes. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes."
- Power: "And Corny Kelleher himself?"
- Martin Cunningham: "At the cemetery."
- Bloom: "I met M'Coy this morning. He said he'd try to come."
- Power: "What's wrong?"
- Martin Cunningham: "We're stopped."
- Power: "Where are we?"
- Martin Cunningham: "The grand canal."
- Power: "The weather is changing, quietly."
- Martin Cunningham: "A pity it did not keep up fine."
- Power: "Wanted for the country. There's the sun again coming out."
- Power: "It's as uncertain as a child's bottom."
- Martin Cunningham: "We're off again."
- Power: "Tom Kernan was immense last night. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face."
- Power: "O, draw him out, Martin, eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Martin."
- Martin Cunningham: "Immense, pompously. His singing of that simple ballad, pure and perfect. Such a true gift for that kind of thing."
- Power: "Trenchant, laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the other one, Balfe's. Let me see..."
- Martin Cunningham: "Did you read Dan Dawson's speech?"
- Dedalus: "I did not then. Where is it?"
- Martin Cunningham: "In the paper this morning."
- Dedalus: "No, no, quickly. Later on please."
- Martin Cunningham: "How do you do? raising his palm to his brow in salute."
- Power: "He doesn't see us. Yes, he does. How do you do?"
- Dedalus: "Who?"
- Power: "Blazes Boylan. There he is airing his quiff."
- Power: "How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?"
- Bloom: "O, very well. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good idea, you see."
- Power: "Are you going yourself?"
- Bloom: "Well no. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business."
- Martin Cunningham: "Quite so. Mary Anderson is up there now."
- Bloom: "Louis Werner is touring her. O yes, we'll have all the topnobbers."
- Power: "And Madame, smiling. Last but not least."
- Voice: "Four bootlaces for a penny."
- Power: "Of the tribe of Reuben."
- Power: "In all his pristine beauty."
- Dedalus: "The devil break the hasp of your back!"
- Martin Cunningham: "We have all been there, broadly."
- Power: "Well, nearly all of us."
- Martin Cunningham: "That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and the son."
- Power: "About the boatman?"
- Martin Cunningham: "Yes. Isn't it awfully good?"
- Dedalus: "What is that? I didn't hear it."
- Bloom: "There was a girl in the case, and he determined to send him to the rightabout."
- Dedalus: "What? That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?"
- Bloom: "Yes. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown him."
- Dedalus: "Drown Barabbas! I wish to Christ he did!"
- Bloom: "No, the son himself....."
- Martin Cunningham: "Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the boat and he tried to drown him."
- Dedalus: "For God's sake! Is he dead?"
- Martin Cunningham: "Dead! Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches."
- Bloom: "Yes. But the funny part is....."
- Martin Cunningham: "And Reuben J, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life."
- Martin Cunningham: "O, he did. Like a hero. A silver florin."
- Bloom: "Isn't it awfully good? eagerly."
- Dedalus: "One and eightpence too much, drily."
- Voice: "Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!"
- Martin Cunningham: "We had better look a little serious."
- Power: "Ah then indeed, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh."
- Power: "The Lord forgive me! wiping his wet eyes with his fingers."
- Dedalus: "As decent a little man as ever wore a hat. He went very suddenly."
- Martin Cunningham: "Breakdown. Heart."
- Power: "He had a sudden death, poor fellow."
- Bloom: "The best death."
- Power: "No suffering. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep."
- Martin Cunningham: "Sad. A child."
- Dedalus: "Poor little thing. It's well out of it."
- Martin Cunningham: "In the midst of life."
- Power: "But the worst of all is the man who takes his own life."
- Power: "The greatest disgrace to have in the family."
- Martin Cunningham: "Temporary insanity, of course. We must take a charitable view of it."
- Dedalus: "They say a man who does it is a coward."
- Martin Cunningham: "It is not for us to judge."
- Martin Cunningham: "We are going the pace, I think."
- Power: "God grant he doesn't upset us on the road."
- Martin Cunningham: "I hope not. That will be a great race tomorrow at the Curragh."
- Dedalus: "Yes, by Jove. That will be worth seeing, faith."
- Power: "What's wrong now?"
- Power: "Emigrants."
- Drover: "Huuuh! his switch sounding on their flanks."
- Power: "I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays."
- Martin Cunningham: "Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare. Quite right."
- Bloom: "Yes, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know."
- Dedalus: "O, that be damned for a story. Pullman car and saloon diningroom."
- Power: "A poor lookout for Corny."
- Bloom: "Why? turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent than galloping two abreast?"
- Dedalus: "Well, there's something in that."
- Martin Cunningham: "And, we wouldn't have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road."
- Power: "That was terrible, and the corpse fell about the place. The head fell off."
- Dedalus: "First round Dunphy's, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup."
- Martin Cunningham: "Praises be to God! piously."
- Power: "Dunphy's, as the carriage turned right."
- Power: "I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on."
- Dedalus: "Better ask Tom Kernan."
- Martin Cunningham: "How is that? Left him weeping, I suppose?"
- Dedalus: "Though lost to sight, to memory dear."
- Power: "That is where Childs was murdered. The last house."
- Dedalus: "So it is. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off."
- Power: "The crown had no evidence."
- Martin Cunningham: "Only circumstantial. That's the maxim of the law."
- Power: "I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom."
- Power: "What? How so?"
- Martin Cunningham: "His father poisoned himself, whispered. Had the Queen's hotel in Longford."
- Power: "O God! First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?"
- Bloom: "Was he insured?"
- Kernan: "I believe so. But the policy was heavily mortgaged."
- Power: "How many children did he leave?"
- Kernan: "Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's."
- Bloom: "A sad case, gently. Five young children."
- Kernan: "A great blow to the poor wife."
- Bloom: "Indeed yes."
- Ned Lambert: "How are you, Simon? softly, clasping hands. Haven't seen you for ages."
- Dedalus: "Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?"
- Ned Lambert: "I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday."
- Dedalus: "And how is Dick, the solid man?"
- Ned Lambert: "Nothing between himself and heaven."
- Dedalus: "By the holy Paul! in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?"
- Ned Lambert: "Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, pointing to the children."
- Dedalus: "Yes, yes, dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?"
- Ned Lambert: "Yes, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid."
- Dedalus: "I'll engage he did. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job."
- Ned Lambert: "How did he lose it? Liquor, what?"
- Dedalus: "Many a good man's fault, with a sigh."
- Dedalus: "The O'Connell circle, about him."
- Dedalus: "He's at rest, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But his heart is buried in Rome."
- Dedalus: "Her grave is over there, Jack. I'll soon be stretched beside her."
- Power: "She's better where she is, kindly."
- Dedalus: "I suppose so, with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven."
- Kernan: "Sad occasions, began politely."
- Kernan: "The others are putting on their hats. I suppose we can do so too."
- Kernan: "The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?"
- Kernan: "The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive, I must say."
- Kernan: "I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man's inmost heart."
- Bloom: "It does."
- Kernan: "Everything went off A1. What?"
- Kernan: "As it should be."
- Corny Kelleher: "What? Eh?"
- John Henry Menton: "Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? I can't see."
- Ned Lambert: "Bloom, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano."
- John Henry Menton: "O, to be sure. I haven't seen her for some time."
- John Henry Menton: "What is he? What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery line?"
- Ned Lambert: "Yes, he was, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper."
- John Henry Menton: "In God's name, what did she marry a coon like that for?"
- Ned Lambert: "Has still. He does some canvassing for ads."
- Power: "John O'Connell, pleased. He never forgets a friend."
- Caretaker: "I am come to pay you another visit."
- Caretaker: "My dear Simon, answered in a low voice. I don't want to be importunate, but..."
- Caretaker: "Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?"
- Martin Cunningham: "I did not."
- Caretaker: "They tell the story, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for a friend's grave."
- Caretaker: "And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like him, says they."
- Martin Cunningham: "That's all done with a purpose, explained to Hynes."
- Hynes: "I know. I know that."
- Martin Cunningham: "To cheer a fellow up. It's pure mockery."
- Caretaker: "How many have you for tomorrow?"
- Corny Kelleher: "Two. Half ten and eleven."
- Hynes: "I am just taking the names, below his breath. What is your christian name? I'm not sure."
- Bloom: "L. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He asked me to."
- Hynes: "Charley, writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once."
- Hynes: "And tell us, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was in the, er..."
- Bloom: "Macintosh. Yes, I saw him. Where is he now?"
- Hynes: "M'Intosh, scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his name?"
- Bloom: "No, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!"
- Hynes: "O, excuse me!"
- Hynes: "Let us go round by the chief's grave. We have time."
- Power: "Let us."
- Hynes: "Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled with stones."
- Hynes: "Parnell will never come again. He's there, all that was mortal of him."
- Bloom: "Excuse me, sir, beside them."
- Bloom: "Your hat is a little crushed, pointing."
- Martin Cunningham: "There, helped, pointing also."
- Martin Cunningham: "It's all right now."
- John Henry Menton: "Thank you, shortly."

## Chapter 7 - Aeolus  

**Setting:** The newspaper office of the Freeman's Journal.

**Dialogue:**

- Voice: "Rathgar and Terenure!"
- Voice: "Come on, Sandymount Green!"
- Voice: "Start, Palmerston Park!"
- Red Murray: "There it is. Alexander Keyes."
- Bloom: "Just cut it out, will you? and I'll take it round to the Telegraph."
- Bloom: "I'll go through the printingworks, taking the cut."
- Red Murray: "Of course, if he wants a par, earnestly, a pen behind his ear."
- Bloom: "Right, with a nod. I'll rub that in."
- Red Murray: "Brayden."
- Red Murray: "Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? whispered."
- Bloom: "Or like Mario."
- Red Murray: "Yes. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour."
- Red Murray: "His grace phoned down twice this morning, gravely."
- Red Murray: "Well, he is one of our saviours also."
- Hynes: "Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor."
- Hynes: "Right: thanks, moving off."
- Red Murray: "If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said."
- Hynes: "Did you?"
- Bloom: "Mm. Look sharp and you'll catch him."
- Hynes: "Thanks, old man. I'll tap him too."
- Bloom: "Excuse me, councillor. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?"
- Bloom: "He wants it in for July."
- Bloom: "But wait. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top."
- Bloom: "Like that, crossing his forefingers at the top."
- Bloom: "Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name."
- Bloom: "You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top in leaded caps the house of keys."
- Bloom: "The idea, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament."
- Foreman: "We can do that. Have you the design?"
- Bloom: "I can get it. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too."
- Foreman: "We can do that. Let him give us a three months' renewal."
- Red Murray: "Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the Telegraph."
- Voice: "Monks, sir? asked from the castingbox."
- Red Murray: "Ay. Where's Monks?"
- Red Murray: "Monks!"
- Bloom: "Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, and you'll give it a good place I know."
- Red Murray: "Monks!"
- Monks: "Yes, sir."
- Professor MacHugh: "The ghost walks, murmured softly, biscuitfully to himself."
- Professor MacHugh: "Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way."
- Dedalus: "Changing his drink."
- Professor MacHugh: "The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. O boys! O boys!"
- Dedalus: "And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, looking again on the mirror."
- Professor MacHugh: "That will do, cried from the window. I don't want to hear any more of that stuff."
- Ned Lambert: "Just another spasm."
- Bloom: "What is it?"
- Professor MacHugh: "A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, answered with a mouthful of biscuit."
- Bloom: "Whose land?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Most pertinent question, between his chews. With an accent on the whose."
- Dedalus: "Dan Dawson's land."
- Bloom: "Is it his speech last night?"
- Professor MacHugh: "But listen to this."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Excuse me, entering."
- Professor MacHugh: "I beg yours."
- Professor MacHugh: "Good day, Jack."
- Professor MacHugh: "Come in. Come in."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Good day."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "How are you, Dedalus?"
- Dedalus: "Well. And yourself?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "You're looking extra."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Is the editor to be seen? looking towards the inner door."
- Professor MacHugh: "Very much so. To be seen and heard. He's in his sanctum with Lenehan."
- Ned Lambert: "Ah, listen to this for God' sake. Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks."
- Professor MacHugh: "Bombast! broke in testily. Enough of the inflated stuff."
- Ned Lambert: "Peaks, went on, towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were..."
- Dedalus: "Bathe his lips. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he dead?"
- Professor MacHugh: "The moon. He forgot Hamlet."
- Dedalus: "O! giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions!"
- Dedalus: "Doughy Daw!"
- Professor MacHugh: "What is it?"
- Professor MacHugh: "And here comes the sham squire himself! said, pointing to the editor."
- Myles Crawford: "Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! said in recognition."
- Dedalus: "Come, Ned, putting on his hat. I must get a drink somewhere."
- Myles Crawford: "Drink! cried. No drinks served before mass."
- Dedalus: "Quite right too, going out. Come on, Ned."
- Ned Lambert: "Will you join us, Myles?"
- Myles Crawford: "North Cork militia! cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We fought every day."
- Ned Lambert: "Where was that, Myles? asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps."
- Myles Crawford: "In Ohio! shouted."
- Ned Lambert: "So it was, begad."
- Professor MacHugh: "Incipient jigs. Sad case."
- Myles Crawford: "Ohio! crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face."
- Professor MacHugh: "A perfect cretic! Long, short and long."
- Myles Crawford: "Bingbang, bangbang."
- Bloom: "Just a moment, Mr Crawford. I just want to phone about an ad."
- Professor MacHugh: "What about that leader this evening? coming forward."
- Myles Crawford: "That'll be all right, more calmly. Never you fret."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Good day, Myles, letting the pages he held slip to the floor."
- Myles Crawford: "Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes."
- Myles Crawford: "Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? Sceptre with O. Madden."
- Lenehan: "Hush. I hear feetstoops."
- Newsboy: "It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir."
- Myles Crawford: "Throw him out and shut the door. There's a hurricane blowing."
- Newsboy: "Waiting for the racing special, sir. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir."
- Myles Crawford: "Him, sir."
- Professor MacHugh: "Out of this with you, gruffly."
- Voice: "Continued on page six, column four."
- Bloom: "Yes, Evening Telegraph here, phoned from the inner office."
- Lenehan: "Pardon, monsieur, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace."
- Bloom: "My fault, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a hurry."
- Lenehan: "Knee."
- Professor MacHugh: "The accumulation of the anno Domini."
- Bloom: "Sorry."
- Bloom: "I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, about this ad."
- Myles Crawford: "Begone! The world is before you."
- Bloom: "Back in no time, hurrying out."
- Professor MacHugh: "He'll get that advertisement, staring through his spectacles."
- Lenehan: "Show. Where? cried, running to the window."
- Lenehan: "Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, pointing."
- Myles Crawford: "What's that? with a start. Where are the other two gone?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Who? turning. They're gone round to the Oval for a drink."
- Myles Crawford: "Come on then. Where's my hat?"
- Professor MacHugh: "He's pretty well on, in a low voice."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Seems to be, taking out a cigarettecase in a leisurely way."
- Lenehan: "Thanky vous, helping himself."
- Myles Crawford: "Eh? You bloody old Roman empire?"
- Lenehan: "Silence for my brandnew riddle!"
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Imperium romanum, gently. It sounds nobler than British empire."
- Lenehan: "That's it. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire."
- Professor MacHugh: "Wait a moment, raising two quiet claws. We mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words."
- Professor MacHugh: "What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers."
- Lenehan: "Which they accordingly did do. Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the running stream."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "They were nature's gentlemen, murmured. But we have the Roman law."
- Professor MacHugh: "And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, responded."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?"
- Lenehan: "First my riddle. Are you ready?"
- Lenehan: "Entrez, mes enfants! cried."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "I escort a suppliant, melodiously. Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety."
- Myles Crawford: "How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your governor is just gone."
- Lenehan: "Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply."
- Myles Crawford: "Who?"
- Stephen: "Mr Garrett Deasy."
- Myles Crawford: "That old pelters. Who tore it? Was he short taken?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Good day, Stephen, coming to peer over their shoulders. The letter is not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy wrote it."
- Stephen: "Good day, sir, blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to..."
- Myles Crawford: "O, I know him, and I knew his wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made."
- Stephen: "Is he a widower?"
- Myles Crawford: "Ay, a grass one, his eye running down the letter."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "The moot point is did he forget it, quietly, or did he not?"
- Myles Crawford: "And if not?"
- Myles Crawford: "I'll tell you how it was. A Hungarian it was one day..."
- Professor MacHugh: "We were always loyal to lost causes. Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination."
- Professor MacHugh: "The Greek! again. Kyrios! Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "They went forth to battle, greyly, but they always fell."
- Lenehan: "Boohoo! wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matinée."
- Professor MacHugh: "There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh for you!"
- Myles Crawford: "That'll be all right. I'll read the rest after. That'll be all right."
- Lenehan: "But my riddle! What opera is like a railwayline?"
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "Opera? sphinx face reriddled."
- Lenehan: "The Rose of Castile. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!"
- Lenehan: "Help! sighed. I feel a strong weakness."
- Myles Crawford: "Paris, past and present. You look like communards."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, in a quiet tone."
- Stephen: "We were only thinking about it."
- Myles Crawford: "All the talents. Law, the classics..."
- Lenehan: "The turf."
- Myles Crawford: "Literature, the press."
- Professor MacHugh: "If Bloom were here. The gentle art of advertisement."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "And Madam Bloom. The vocal muse. Dublin's prime favourite."
- Professor MacHugh: "Ahem! very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park."
- Myles Crawford: "I want you to write something for me. Something with a bite in it."
- Myles Crawford: "Foot and mouth disease! cried in scornful invective. Great scourge of our time."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "We can all supply mental pabulum."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "He wants you for the pressgang."
- Myles Crawford: "You can do it, repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis."
- Myles Crawford: "Look at here, turning. The New York World cabled for a special."
- Myles Crawford: "New York World, excitedly pushing back his straw hat. Where the deuce did they hear of it?"
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "Skin-the-Goat. Fitzharris. He has that cabman's shelter."
- Myles Crawford: "Hop and carry one, is it?"
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation."
- Myles Crawford: "Gumley? You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is it?"
- Myles Crawford: "Never mind Gumley, cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the stones."
- Myles Crawford: "Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. Have you seen it?"
- Professor MacHugh: "I'll answer it, going."
- Myles Crawford: "B is parkgate. Good."
- Myles Crawford: "T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon gate."
- Bloom: "Hello? Evening Telegraph here... Hello?... Who's there?... Yes..."
- Myles Crawford: "F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi."
- Professor MacHugh: "Bloom is at the telephone, he said."
- Myles Crawford: "Tell him go to hell, promptly. X is Davy's publichouse."
- Lenehan: "Clever. Very."
- Myles Crawford: "Gave it to them on a hot plate, the whole bloody history."
- Myles Crawford: "I saw it, proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman God ever put on the earth."
- Myles Crawford: "Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba."
- Myles Crawford: "History! cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was there first."
- Lenehan: "The father of scare journalism, confirmed, and the brother of the great writer of our time."
- Bloom: "Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across and have a..."
- Myles Crawford: "Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? cried."
- Lenehan: "Clamn dever, to Mr O'Madden Burke."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "Very smart."
- Myles Crawford: "Talking about the invincibles, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder..."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "O yes, eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year."
- Myles Crawford: "They're only in the hook and eye department."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "Speak up for yourself."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "My dear Myles, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words."
- Myles Crawford: "Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, cried in his rich baritone of ridicule."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Well, Bushe K.C., for example."
- Myles Crawford: "Bushe? Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in his blood."
- Professor MacHugh: "He would have been on the bench long ago, only for..."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life was Fitzgibbon's."
- Professor MacHugh: "What was that?"
- J. J. O'Molloy: "He spoke on the law of evidence, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis."
- Professor MacHugh: "Ha."
- Lenehan: "A few wellchosen words, prefaced. Silence!"
- J. J. O'Molloy: "He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live."
- Myles Crawford: "Fine! at once."
- Mr O'Madden Burke: "The divine afflatus."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "You like it? asked Stephen."
- Stephen: "Muchibus thankibus."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you."
- Professor MacHugh: "No, thanks, waving the cigarettecase aside."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his mind."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "He is sitting with Tim Healy, rumour has it, on the Trinity estates to purchase a small property."
- Myles Crawford: "He is sitting with a sweet thing, in a child's coffined chair."
- Professor MacHugh: "It was the speech, mark you, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction, I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely upon the new movement."
- Professor MacHugh: "Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall."
- Professor MacHugh: "When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply."
- Professor MacHugh: "And yet he died without having entered the land of promise."
- Professor MacHugh: "A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—expectorated—demise."
- Professor MacHugh: "That is oratory, uncontradicted."
- Stephen: "Gentlemen. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?"
- Myles Crawford: "You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?"
- Stephen: "That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour say ay, contrary minded no."
- Professor MacHugh: "We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes. We will not."
- Stephen: "Lay on, Macduff!"
- Myles Crawford: "Chip of the old block! cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder."
- Myles Crawford: "Foot and mouth. I know. That'll be all right. That'll go in. Where are you going?"
- J. J. O'Molloy: "I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment."
- Professor MacHugh: "Come along, Stephen. That is fine, isn't it? It has the prophetic vision."
- Voice: "Racing special!"
- Stephen: "I have a vision too."
- Professor MacHugh: "Yes? skipping to get into step. Crawford will arrange it."
- Voice: "Racing special!"
- Stephen: "Two Dublin vestals, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane."
- Professor MacHugh: "Where is that?"
- Stephen: "Off Blackpitts."
- Stephen: "They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar."
- Professor MacHugh: "Wise virgins."
- Stephen: "They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city dining rooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress..."
- Professor MacHugh: "Antithesis, nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see them."
- Professor MacHugh: "Come along, cried, waving his arm."
- Stephen: "Yes. I see them."
- Myles Crawford: "Mr Crawford! A moment!"
- Voice: "Telegraph! Racing special!"
- Myles Crawford: "What is it? falling back a pace."
- Voice: "Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!"
- Bloom: "Just this ad, pushing through towards the steps."
- Myles Crawford: "Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? throwing his straw hat on the table."
- Bloom: "Well, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I think it'll be all right."
- Myles Crawford: "He can kiss my royal Irish arse, cried loudly over his shoulder."
- J. J. O'Molloy: "Nulla bona, Jack, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to here."
- Stephen: "When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper napkin ringed with guineas, they go nearer to the railings."
- Professor MacHugh: "Something for you, explained to Myles Crawford. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar."
- Myles Crawford: "That's new. That's copy. Out for the waxies' Dargle."
- Stephen: "But they are afraid the pillar will fall. They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines' blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's."
- Myles Crawford: "Easy all. No poetic licence. We're in the Freeman."
- Stephen: "And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer."
- Professor MacHugh: "Onehandled adulterer! I like that. I see the idea."
- Stephen: "It gives them a crick in their necks, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak."
- Myles Crawford: "Finished? So long as they do no worse."
- Professor MacHugh: "You remind me of Antisthenes, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist."
- Myles Crawford: "But what do you call it? Where did they get the plums?"
- Professor MacHugh: "Call it, wait, opening his long lips wide to reflect. Call it, let me see."
- Stephen: "No. I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of The Plums."
- Professor MacHugh: "I see."
- Professor MacHugh: "I see, again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land."
- Professor MacHugh: "I see."
- Professor MacHugh: "Onehandled adulterer, smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must say."
- Myles Crawford: "Tickled the old ones too, if the God Almighty's truth was known."
