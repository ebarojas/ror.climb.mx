# James Joyce's Ulysses, down to only dialogue and setting

This is an abridged version of James Joyce's Ulysses, showing only the dialog and the basic chapter setting. I have not edited this heavily, the content here has been extracted from Gutenberg Project's txt file with a python script and is used within the limits of the license provided in that text.

## Chapter 1 - Telemachus

**Setting:** Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned.

**Dialogue:**

- Buck Mulligan: "Introibo ad altare Dei."
- Buck Mulligan: "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Back to barracks!"
- Buck Mulligan: "For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all."
- Buck Mulligan: "Thanks, old chap. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?"
- Buck Mulligan: "The mockery of it! Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!"
- Buck Mulligan: "My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Will he come? The jejune jesuit!"
- Stephen: "Tell me, Mulligan, how long is Haines going to stay in this tower?"
- Buck Mulligan: "God, isn't he dreadful? A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade."
- Stephen: "He was raving all night about a black panther. Where is his guncase?"
- Buck Mulligan: "A woful lunatic! Were you in a funk?"
- Stephen: "I was, out here in the dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off."
- Buck Mulligan: "The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't let me have anything to do with you."
- Stephen: "Someone killed her."
- Buck Mulligan: "You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you..."
- Stephen: "I am not thinking of the offence to my mother."
- Buck Mulligan: "Of what then?"
- Stephen: "Of the offence to me."
- Buck Mulligan: "O, an impossible person!"
- Haines: "Are you up there, Mulligan?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm coming."
- Buck Mulligan: "Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers."
- Buck Mulligan: "Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding."
- Buck Mulligan: "Kinch ahoy!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines apologises for waking us. He said goodbye."
- Stephen: "I'm coming."
- Buck Mulligan: "Do, for Jesus' sake, for my sake and for all our sakes."
- Buck Mulligan: "I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean."
- Stephen: "I get paid this morning."
- Buck Mulligan: "The school kip? How much? Four quid? Lend us one."
- Stephen: "If you want it."
- Buck Mulligan: "Four shining sovereigns, we'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids."
- Buck Mulligan: "We'll be choked. Haines, open that door, will you?"
- Haines: "Have you the key?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Dedalus has it. Janey Mack, I'm choked!"
- Stephen: "It's in the lock."
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm melting, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject!"
- Buck Mulligan: "What sort of a kip is this? I told her to come after eight."
- Stephen: "We can drink it black, there's a lemon in the locker."
- Buck Mulligan: "O, damn you and your Paris fads! I want Sandycove milk."
- Buck Mulligan: "That woman is coming up with the milk."
- Buck Mulligan: "The blessings of God on you! In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm giving you two lumps each. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don't you?"
- Buck Mulligan: "When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water."
- Haines: "By Jove, it is tea."
- Buck Mulligan: "So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma'am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don't make them in the one pot."
- Buck Mulligan: "That's folk, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind."
- Stephen: "Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?"
- Stephen: "I doubt it."
- Buck Mulligan: "Do you now? Your reasons, pray?"
- Stephen: "I fancy, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion."
- Buck Mulligan: "Charming! showing his white teeth and thumbing his lip. The quaint name of the quaint old lady. It's like a name out of Ibsen. I suppose she was a Yiddisher."
- Old woman: "The milk, sir!"
- Buck Mulligan: "Come in, ma'am. Kinch, get the jug."
- Old woman: "That's a lovely morning, sir. Glory be to God."
- Buck Mulligan: "To whom? Ah, to be sure!"
- Buck Mulligan: "The islanders speak frequently of the beast by that name, Stephen said to Haines casually."
- Old woman: "How much, sir?"
- Stephen: "A quart."
- Buck Mulligan: "It is indeed, ma'am, pouring milk into their cups."
- Old woman: "Taste it, sir."
- Buck Mulligan: "If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits."
- Old woman: "Are you a medical student, sir?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I am, ma'am."
- Old woman: "Look at that now."
- Stephen: "Do you understand what he says?"
- Old woman: "Is it French you are talking, sir?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Irish. Is there Gaelic on you?"
- Old woman: "I thought it was Irish, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?"
- Haines: "I am an Englishman."
- Buck Mulligan: "He's English, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland."
- Old woman: "Sure we ought to, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows."
- Buck Mulligan: "Grand is no name for it. Wonderful entirely. Fill out the place for the tea."
- Old woman: "No, thank you, sir, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go."
- Haines: "Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?"
- Old woman: "Bill, sir? Well, it's seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings every other day at twopence is three twos is sixpence and one and two is two and two, sir."
- Haines: "Pay up and look pleasant, smiling."
- Buck Mulligan: "A miracle! Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give."
- Buck Mulligan: "We'll owe twopence."
- Old woman: "Time enough, sir, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir."
- Buck Mulligan: "Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty."
- Haines: "That reminds me, rising, that I have to visit your national library today."
- Buck Mulligan: "Our swim first."
- Buck Mulligan: "Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?"
- Buck Mulligan: "The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month."
- Stephen: "All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf."
- Haines: "I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me."
- Haines: "That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good."
- Buck Mulligan: "Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines."
- Haines: "Well, I mean it, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in."
- Stephen: "Would I make any money by it?"
- Haines: "I don't know, I'm sure."
- Buck Mulligan: "You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?"
- Stephen: "Well? The problem is to get money. From whom? From the queen or from her successor?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I blow him out about you, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes."
- Stephen: "I see little hope, from her or from him."
- Buck Mulligan: "From me, Kinch."
- Buck Mulligan: "To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don't you play them as I do?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Mulligan is stripped of his garments."
- Buck Mulligan: "There's your snotrag."
- Buck Mulligan: "And there's your Latin quarter hat."
- Haines: "Are you coming, you fellows?"
- Buck Mulligan: "I'm ready. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose."
- Buck Mulligan: "Did you bring the key?"
- Stephen: "I have it, preceding them."
- Buck Mulligan: "Down, sir! How dare you, sir!"
- Haines: "Do you pay rent for this tower?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Twelve quid."
- Stephen: "To the secretary of state for war, over his shoulder."
- Haines: "Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Billy Pitt had them built when the French were on the sea. But ours is the omphalos."
- Haines: "What is your idea of Hamlet?"
- Buck Mulligan: "No, no, I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first."
- Buck Mulligan: "You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?"
- Stephen: "It has waited so long, it can wait longer."
- Haines: "You pique my curiosity. Is it some paradox?"
- Buck Mulligan: "Pooh! We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father."
- Haines: "What? beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?"
- Buck Mulligan: "O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!"
- Stephen: "We're always tired in the morning, to Haines. And it is rather long to tell."
- Buck Mulligan: "The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus."
- Haines: "I mean to say, explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o'er his base into the sea, isn't it?"
- Haines: "It's a wonderful tale, bringing them to halt again."
- Stephen: "I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father."
- Buck Mulligan: "We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn't it?"
- Stephen: "The ballad of joking Jesus."
- Haines: "O, you have heard it before?"
- Stephen: "Three times a day, after meals."
- Haines: "You're not a believer, are you? I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God."

## Chapter 2 - Nestor

**Setting:** A classroom where Stephen teaches his students about history. The boy's blank face asked the blank window. Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.

**Dialogue:**

- Stephen: "You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?"
- Cochrane: "Tarentum, sir."
- Stephen: "Very good. Well?"
- Student: "There was a battle, sir."
- Stephen: "Very good. Where?"
- Student: "I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C."
- Stephen: "Asculum, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book."
- Student: "Yes, sir. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for."
- Stephen: "You, Armstrong. What was the end of Pyrrhus?"
- Armstrong: "End of Pyrrhus, sir?"
- Comyn: "I know, sir. Ask me, sir."
- Stephen: "Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?"
- Armstrong: "Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier."
- Stephen: "Tell me now, poking the boy's shoulder with the book, what is a pier."
- Armstrong: "A pier, sir. A thing out in the water. A kind of a bridge."
- Stephen: "Kingstown pier. Yes, a disappointed bridge."
- Comyn: "How, sir? A bridge is across a river."
- Student: "Tell us a story, sir."
- Student: "O, do, sir. A ghoststory."
- Stephen: "Where do you begin in this? opening another book."
- Comyn: "Weep no more."
- Stephen: "Go on then, Talbot."
- Student: "And the story, sir?"
- Stephen: "After. Go on, Talbot."
- Stephen: "Turn over, quietly. I don't see anything."
- Talbot: "What, sir? simply, bending forward."
- Stephen: "Have I heard all?"
- Student: "Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir."
- Student: "Half day, sir. Thursday."
- Stephen: "Who can answer a riddle?"
- Student: "A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir."
- Student: "O, ask me, sir."
- Student: "A hard one, sir."
- Stephen: "This is the riddle: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven."
- Student: "What, sir?"
- Student: "Again, sir. We didn't hear."
- Stephen: "What is it? We give it up."
- Stephen: "The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush."
- Students: "Hockey!"
- Sargent: "Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, and show them to you, sir."
- Stephen: "Do you understand how to do them now?"
- Sargent: "Numbers eleven to fifteen. Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir."
- Stephen: "Can you do them yourself?"
- Sargent: "No, sir."
- Stephen: "Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?"
- Sargent: "Yes, sir."
- Stephen: "It is very simple, as he stood up."
- Sargent: "Yes, sir. Thanks."
- Stephen: "You had better get your stick and go out to the others, as they are finished for the day."
- Sargent: "Yes, sir."
- Stephen: "Sargent!"
- Stephen: "Run on. Mr Deasy is calling you."
- Mr. Deasy: "What is it now? continually without listening."
- Stephen: "Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir."
- Mr. Deasy: "Will you wait in my study for a moment, till I restore order here."
- Mr. Deasy: "What is the matter? What is it now?"
- Mr. Deasy: "First, our little financial settlement."
- Mr. Deasy: "Two, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away."
- Mr. Deasy: "Three, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand."
- Mr. Deasy: "Three twelve. I think you'll find that's right."
- Stephen: "Thank you, sir, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers."
- Mr. Deasy: "No thanks at all. You have earned it."
- Stephen: "I owe thanks."
- Mr. Deasy: "Don't carry it like that. You'll pull it out somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very handy."
- Stephen: "Mine would be often empty."
- Mr. Deasy: "Because you don't save, pointing his finger. You don't know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? Put but money in thy purse."
- Stephen: "Iago."
- Mr. Deasy: "He knew what money was. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English?"
- Stephen: "That on his empire the sun never sets."
- Mr. Deasy: "Ba! That's not English. A French Celt said that. He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail."
- Mr. Deasy: "I will tell you, solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid my way."
- Stephen: "Good man, good man."
- Mr. Deasy: "I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel that? I owe nothing. Can you?"
- Stephen: "For the moment, no."
- Mr. Deasy: "I knew you couldn't, joyously. But one day you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also be just."
- Stephen: "I fear those big words, which make us so unhappy."
- Mr. Deasy: "You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine in '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things."
- Stephen: "To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher."
- Mr. Deasy: "I have rebel blood in me too. On the spindle side. But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all Irish, all kings' sons."
- Stephen: "Alas."
- Mr. Deasy: "Per vias rectas, was his motto. He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do it."
- Stephen: "Lal the ral the ra, The rocky road to Dublin."
- Mr. Deasy: "That reminds me. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here."
- Mr. Deasy: "Sit down. Excuse me, over his shoulder, the dictates of common sense. Just a moment."
- Mr. Deasy: "Full stop, to his keys. But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question..."
- Mr. Deasy: "Now then, rising."
- Mr. Deasy: "I have put the matter into a nutshell. It's about the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions on the matter."
- Mr. Deasy: "I don't mince words, do I? as Stephen read on."
- Mr. Deasy: "I want that to be printed and read. You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by..."
- Mr. Deasy: "Mark my words, Mr Dedalus. England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying."
- Mr. Deasy: "Dying, again, if not dead by now."
- Stephen: "A merchant, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?"
- Mr. Deasy: "They sinned against the light, gravely. And you can see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day."
- Stephen: "Who has not?"
- Mr. Deasy: "What do you mean?"
- Stephen: "History, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."
- Mr. Deasy: "The ways of the Creator are not our ways. All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God."
- Stephen: "That is God."
- Mr. Deasy: "What?"
- Stephen: "A shout in the street, shrugging his shoulders."
- Mr. Deasy: "Very good then."
- Mr. Deasy: "I am happier than you are. We have committed many errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end."
- Student: "Well, sir."
- Mr. Deasy: "I foresee, that you will not remain here very long at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong."
- Stephen: "A learner rather."
- Mr. Deasy: "Who knows? To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher."
- Mr. Deasy: "As regards these."
- Mr. Deasy: "Yes. You have two copies there. If you can have them published. I have never asked a personal favour before, never. Could you try?"
- Stephen: "I will try, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly."
- Mr. Deasy: "That will do, briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M. P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?"
- Stephen: "The Evening Telegraph..."
- Mr. Deasy: "That will do. There is no time to lose. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin."
- Stephen: "Good morning, sir, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you."
- Mr. Deasy: "Not at all, as he searched the papers on his desk. I like to break a lance with you, old as I am."
- Stephen: "Good morning, sir, again, bowing to his bent back."
- Mr. Deasy: "Mr Dedalus!"
- Mr. Deasy: "Just one moment."
- Stephen: "Yes, sir, turning back at the gate."
- Mr. Deasy: "I just wanted to say. Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And do you know why?"
- Stephen: "Why, sir? beginning to smile."
- Mr. Deasy: "Because she never let them in, solemnly."
- Mr. Deasy: "She never let them in, again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why."
