# Bouldering Through Docker Containers

Docker containers are like bouldering problems - short, intense, and requiring precise technique. Each container is a self-contained problem that you need to solve efficiently.

## The Problem

Traditional development environments are like trad climbing - you need to place your own protection and hope everything holds. Docker containers are more like bouldering - everything you need is right there, but the moves are more technical.

## The Solution

Docker provides the crash pad for your development environment. You can fall (make mistakes) without breaking your system, and each attempt teaches you something new about the problem.

## Key Moves

- **Building images**: Like warming up on easy problems
- **Running containers**: The main problem you're trying to solve
- **Networking**: Connecting different problems together
- **Volumes**: Your chalk bag - persistent data across attempts

## Common Falls

- Forgetting to expose ports
- Not understanding the difference between images and containers
- Ignoring the Dockerfile best practices
- Trying to solve everything in one container

## The Send

When everything works together - your containers communicate, your data persists, and your application runs smoothly - that's the feeling of topping out on a challenging boulder problem.

*Keep climbing, keep coding!*
