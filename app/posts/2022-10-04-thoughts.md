Some scattered but important thoughts reflecting on the 10 year anniversary of my very near death experience. I wrote this in stream of thought at 5:30am, on 4.10.2012 at roughly 7:30am my accident happened.

These are my learnings and conclusions:

- Death is closer than it appears, life is a short trip and you better make the best of it.
- It's not so bad. I've almost completely stopped climbing but I miss it dearly. The psychological impact has been very strong, even knowing that it would be. Personal life has been good.
- No amount money or material thing is worth losing peace over.
- You are alone in the world, but network and friendships matter.
- Do what you want.

What do I want for the future?

- Time
- Peace
- Love
- Purpose
- Art
- Friendship
- Knowledge
- Food and nurturing
- Health

Today, celebrating 10 years after the experience:

- Eat good food in good company
- Read
- Write
- Woodwork
- Walk
