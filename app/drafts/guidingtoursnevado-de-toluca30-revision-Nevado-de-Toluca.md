Often overlooked,[ Nevado de Toluca is a beautiful volcano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevado_de_Toluca) and regardless of the training value it has as another 4,000 peak prior to Pico or Izta (which is significant), it is one of the most impressive and accessible volcanoes in México.

Overall, its a fun outing, the altitude effects are much less than on izta and the views are impressive, which make for an ideal day trip with a unique character.

Even though *nevado* actually means snow clad, it is only very seldom [that you find snow](http://mxclimb.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/me-the-dogs/ "Snow clad nevado"), and even when you do, no more than a good pair of boots is needed, (ie: no crampons or ice axe).

All prices are in american dollars, and for groups larger than 5 there are two guides and a *BIG* van. We can arrange a pick up for a reasonable fee, otherwise we depart from[ metro taxqueña](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=mexico+city,+metro+taxque%C3%B1a&hl=en&ie=UTF8&cid=15902802205153964616), close to the south bus station.

On a clear day, the main summit of Nevado is nothing shot of impressive.
