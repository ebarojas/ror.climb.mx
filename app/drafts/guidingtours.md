It’s all about experiences, be it fighting for breath on a 5,000m volcano, fighting for grip on a 500m wall or just reading about it. Adventure and experiences are what this blog is about, and it’s what we have to offer on the guided tours.

Mexico has high volcanoes, steep walls, deep gorges and some of the greatest mountain ranges in the world. It is perhaps not the best choice for serious high altitude mountaineering (not nearly as technical as the Andes, Alps or Rockys), however, its summits, trails and climbs can provide an exceptional challenge for all.

Should the call of the wild prevail, it also has some of the most remote, inaccessible and harsh environments in North America, through which we can cater even to the most demanding clients.
