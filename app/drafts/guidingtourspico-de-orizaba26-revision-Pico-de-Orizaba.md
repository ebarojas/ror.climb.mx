Without a doubt, [Pico (5,630 m)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_de_orizaba) is the hardest and most impressive of the mexican volcanoes, it’s also the one that demands the most; Pico is the highest peak in Mexico, the third highest peak in North America and the second most prominent volcanic peak in the world.

Note the massive topographic prominence.</figcaption></figure>The climbing is very strenuous, and due to the logistics of the trip and the absence of a hut in the middle, the climb is made in one big, long push. Starting at 4,270 m (in Piedra Grande hut) and ending at almost 5,700m, which means <span style="text-decoration:underline;">speed</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stamina</span> are of the essence. It is much harder and committing than Izta.

Unless you have proper mountaineering experience you should climb Izta first to acquire the necessary skills and get acclimatized.

All prices are in american dollars, and for groups larger than 5 there are two guides and a *BIG* van. We can arrange a pick up for a reasonable fee, otherwise we depart from[ metro taxqueña](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=mexico+city,+metro+taxque%C3%B1a&hl=en&ie=UTF8&cid=15902802205153964616), close to the south bus station. Gear includes an ice axe and strap-on crampons. Transport for Pico is very expensive because of the need to hire a 4wd vehicle to get us and the supplies to the Piedra Grande hut.

| **\# of people** | **Services (per person)** | **Transport (per person)** | **Gear (per person)** |

| **1 – 2** | 200 usd | 150 usd | 35 usd |
