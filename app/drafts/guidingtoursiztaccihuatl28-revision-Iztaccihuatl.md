[Izta is a very interesting and intriguing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtacc%C3%ADhuatl) mountain; It’s an amalgamation of 6 volcanos from different eras overlapped into a big, stretched *massif*. Because of this, climbing Izta is not entirely straight forward, the route has many fine details and although it’s not technical, it is easy to loose your bearings, even more so when the ever present fog comes down.

It isn’t a technical ascent, however you spend the better part of a day at more than 4,700 m and more often than not, the altitude does take its toll. [Acute mountain sickness ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness)is all to common, usually making altitude and exhaustion the hardest obstacles.

Conditions vary *a lot*, depending on the time of year and the route, climbing Izta can range from high altitude trekking to serious mountaineering (though these conditions are highly unlikely). On a normal day it’s generally an easy, albeit very strenuous climb.

Izta can be climbed any time of year, even though during the rainy season the chances of getting to the summit decrease significantly. Ironically, it is during the rainy season, with more snow, when the mountain is at its prettiest. In any case, the best time is probably winter, just after the rainy season.

All prices are in american dollars, and for groups larger than 5 there are two guides and a *BIG* van. We can arrange a pick up for a reasonable fee, otherwise we depart from[ metro taxqueña](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=mexico+city,+metro+taxque%C3%B1a&hl=en&ie=UTF8&cid=15902802205153964616), close to the south bus station. Gear includes an ice axe and strap-on crampons.
