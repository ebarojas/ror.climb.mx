## Episode Notes

### I. The Theft (Choice)
**The hubris of signing up**
- Godfather's 5-speed bicycle, too big to ride
- PBP dreams deferred (2015, 2019, 2023 - a trilogy of failure)
- "I can't wait much longer" (famous last words)
- SON nabendynamo: £450 of commitment
- Building wheels because you're too scared to let someone else do it properly

### II. The Binding (Consequence)
**18 months of unnecessary suffering**
- Goran Kropp cosplay: bike to Izta, climb, return
- Wheelbuilding with Jorge (trying not to embarrass yourself)
- Each training ride structurally more absurd than the last
- The injury: a gift from the gods for your presumption

### III. The Liver Grows Back (Cycle)
**The months before: futility incarnate**
- Train hard → injury worsens
- Rest → fitness fades
- Repeat until insane
- Each ride necessary, each ride futile
- The liver regenerates, the eagle sharpens its beak

### IV. The Eagle Returns (Endurance)
**LEL itself: the daily torment**
- Travel, bike prep, motivation death spiral
- Each control = night (liver regenerates via pasta)
- Each leg = day (eagle devours via saddle)
- Pain as metronome
- Red everywhere (blood? inflammation? British phone boxes?)

### V. The Ring of Stone (Transformation)
**Freed, but marked forever**
- LEL cancelled (Zeus got tired? Budget cuts?)
- 250km final night arriving 3am (spite as fuel)
- Can barely pedal, finally understand the wound
- Fens wind cover with new friends (fellowship of the suffering)
- Breakfast together (communion of the damned)
- Forced rest at home
- Forever wearing the ring: knee brace and stories

## Why This Comedy Pairing?

- **David Mitchell**: Internal monologue of self-aware terrible decisions, the rant about illogic while committing anyway ("I've been thinking about PBP since 2015..." followed by explaining why that's absurd)
- **Chaplin**: Physical comedy of building wheels, training disasters, the pratfalls of preparation
- **Python**: The absurdist loop of train/injure/rest/repeat (Spanish Inquisition sketch energy)
- **Hicks**: Dark commentary on choosing suffering ("I paid money for this")
- **Maria Bamford**: The cycle of breakdown/recovery made into art, understanding that transformation doesn't mean fixed—just different, marked by the experience

## Art/Colour Rationale

**Blue** (Choice): Contemplative, planning, the calm before
**Orange** (Consequence): Warning signs ignored, danger acknowledged too late
**Grey** (Cycle): Monotonous repetition, the colour of hope dying daily
**Red** (Endurance): Pain, inflammation, British postboxes, arterial spray
**Gold** (Transformation): The sublime taming of the horrible, value extracted from liver

## Adventure Parallels

**I. Journey to the Centre of the Earth - Crane Brothers**
Golden age/Renaissance of exploration and bicycle travel. The optimistic beginning when everything works perfectly—the planning stage, the dream, the SON nabendynamo still in its box, wheels not yet built. This is the Jules Verne version of LEL, where adventure is glorious and technology will save us. The title inspiration for your post, but ironically representing the innocent belief before descent.

**II. Seven Years in Tibet - Harrer**
Adventure has consequences. Starts as an Everest expedition, ends with Harrer trapped in Tibet for the war years, separated from his family, his first son born while he's gone. The climb costs something personal. Like your 18 months of training—it starts as preparation but becomes sacrifice. The Goran Kropp ride to Izta, the wheelbuilding with Jorge, each structurally absurd training ride. You're binding yourself to this, and it's costing more than you planned.

**III. Ultimate High - Kropp**
The perfect cycle embodiment. Kropp bikes from Sweden to Everest, summits solo without oxygen or sherpa support, bikes home. Ultimate high indeed. But then the cycle begins—risk, payoff, risk again. Legal battles, moving to the US seeking something, then dying in a random climbing accident when a rope breaks at Airforce Falls. His book opens: "I don't want to die, not yet at least." The liver regenerates, the eagle returns. Each ride necessary, each ride futile, the injury worsening. The premonition of futility.

**IV. Touching the Void - Simpson**
The injured endurance story. Joe Simpson breaks his leg catastrophically on Siula Grande in Peru. His partner Simon Yates tries to lower him down but has to cut the rope, certain Simpson is dead. Simpson falls into a crevasse, crawls out with shattered leg, drags himself across the glacier for three days without food or water, arrives at base camp hours before his partners plan to leave. Every movement agony, given up for dead, the dark joke being he kept going anyway. Your LEL—each control point a small victory, each leg between them pure suffering. Pain as metronome. The eagle eating your liver daily. Red everywhere—inflammation, British postboxes, the arterial understanding that you chose this. "I paid money for this."

**V. Nanga Parbat - Messner**
Reinhold Messner and his brother Günther attempt Nanga Parbat (Naked Mountain) in 1970. They summit via an impossible route, descend a different face, Günther dies in an avalanche, Reinhold barely survives—loses seven toes to frostbite, hallucinates, crawls for days. Returns transformed, traumatized, controversial (accused of abandoning his brother). Spends decades defending the climb. Forever marked by that mountain. The LEL cancellation, your 250km final night arriving at 3am barely able to pedal, the fellowship in the Fens, forced rest at home. You returned but you're not the same. Forever wearing the ring—knee brace and stories. (The joke about Messner: when he returned barely alive, his best friend's wife nursed him back to health—he later married her. "Luckily my best friend's wife didn't look after me or I might have remarried.")
