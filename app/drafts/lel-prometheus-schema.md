## Episode Notes

### I. The Theft (Choice)
**The hubris of signing up**
- Godfather's 5-speed bicycle, too big to ride
- PBP dreams deferred (2015, 2019, 2023 - a trilogy of failure)
- "I can't wait much longer" (famous last words)
- SON nabendynamo: £450 of commitment
- Building wheels because you're too scared to let someone else do it properly

### II. The Binding (Consequence)
**18 months of unnecessary suffering**
- Goran Kropp cosplay: bike to Izta, climb, return
- Wheelbuilding with Jorge (trying not to embarrass yourself)
- Each training ride structurally more absurd than the last
- The injury: a gift from the gods for your presumption

### III. The Liver Grows Back (Cycle)
**The months before: futility incarnate**
- Train hard → injury worsens
- Rest → fitness fades
- Repeat until insane
- Each ride necessary, each ride futile
- The liver regenerates, the eagle sharpens its beak

### IV. The Eagle Returns (Endurance)
**LEL itself: the daily torment**
- Travel, bike prep, motivation death spiral
- Each control = night (liver regenerates via pasta)
- Each leg = day (eagle devours via saddle)
- Pain as metronome
- Red everywhere (blood? inflammation? British phone boxes?)

### V. The Ring of Stone (Transformation)
**Freed, but marked forever**
- LEL cancelled (Zeus got tired? Budget cuts?)
- 250km final night arriving 3am (spite as fuel)
- Can barely pedal, finally understand the wound
- Fens wind cover with new friends (fellowship of the suffering)
- Breakfast together (communion of the damned)
- Forced rest at home
- Forever wearing the ring: knee brace and stories

## Why This Comedy Pairing?

- **Acaster**: Overthinking everything, spiraling into decisions ("I've been thinking about PBP since 2015...")
- **Chaplin**: Physical comedy of building wheels, training disasters, the pratfalls of preparation
- **Python**: The absurdist loop of train/injure/rest/repeat (Spanish Inquisition sketch energy)
- **Hicks**: Dark commentary on choosing suffering ("I paid money for this")
- **Gadsby**: Trauma reconfigured as growth narrative (Nanette-style transformation)

## Art/Colour Rationale

**Blue** (Choice): Contemplative, planning, the calm before
**Orange** (Consequence): Warning signs ignored, danger acknowledged too late
**Grey** (Cycle): Monotonous repetition, the colour of hope dying daily
**Red** (Endurance): Pain, inflammation, British postboxes, arterial spray
**Gold** (Transformation): The sublime taming of the horrible, value extracted from liver
