Knowing what gear to take to any adventure is important; forget your rain coat on a rainy day and the rest of the trip might be ruined. It is often the right tool makes the job easy, hence, I’ll provide a basic list of gear for the guided trips:

**Gear list 1:** (for Nevado &amp; other daytrips)

- Fleece jacket and rain coat or wind breaker, preferably Gore-Tex or something equivalent.
- Lightweight comfortable walking pants, (**no** jeans). Rain pants are a good idea if the weather is not nice.
- Comfortable &amp; sturdy footwear. Avoid fancy sneakers -they’ll be ruined- and opt for medium weight trekking boots.
- Medium or lightweight gloves, waterproof if possible.
- Sunblock &amp; **sunglasses**.
- Headlamp/torch, (something that[ looks like this](http://www.petzl.com/files/imagecache/product_outdoor_slideshow_zoom/node_media/e97-pm_1.jpg)).
- 2 litres of water and snacks for the day (granola, random cookies or better yet, chocolate :-)
- Small backpack -around 30 litres. (Only for day trips).
- Personal medical kit; bandages, band aids and **painkillers** (aspirin, tylenol, advil, etc). These work wonders to stop headaches induced by acute mountain sickness.
- Tissue or toilet paper and a trash bag to discard them. Runny noses -and occasionally runny stomachs- can be had by anyone.
- A hat of some sort is probably a good idea.
- Don’t forget your camera!

**Gear list 2:** (for Iztaccíhuatl and Pico)

- Include everything from Gear list 1 and add:
- 1-2 litres of water -3-4 L total- and food for dinner &amp; breakfast. Carbohydrates, dried fruit and sandwiches are all time favourites.
- Any sleeping bag good for around 5 °C.
- Sleeping mat; thermarest or something similar.
- Internal frame backpack -around 60 litres-.
- Some sleeping clothes &amp; an extra pair of socks. Don’t take unnecessary clothes, keeping the weight low is important.
- If you have stiff mountaineering boots with step on crampons and an ice axe you can bring them along. If not, we will provide you with a proper ice axe and strap on crampons.
- If you are used to trekking poles, bring them.
- A helmet is not a bad idea either, we can usually provide one as well.
- Extra clothes for the return home. These will be left in the van.
- For Pico de Orizaba, a harness and a locking carabiner is usually needed, again, if you don’t have one we can arrange something.
