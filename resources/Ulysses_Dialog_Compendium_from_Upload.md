—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.
—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.
—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
—Yes, my love?
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
—Scutter! he cried thickly.
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one
—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at
—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m
—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
—Are you up there, Mulligan?
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the
—Kinch ahoy!
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.
—If you want it, Stephen said.
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?
—Have you the key? a voice asked.
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!
—Kinch!
—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
—That woman is coming up with the milk.
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines
—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
—The milk, sir!
—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
—How much, sir? asked the old woman.
—A quart, Stephen said.
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
—Taste it, sir, she said.
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.
—Look at that now, she said.
—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?
—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
—A miracle!
—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
—I don’t know, I’m sure.
—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
—From me, Kinch, he said.
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they
—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
—There’s your snotrag, he said.
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.
—Are you coming, you fellows?
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
—And going forth he met Butterly.
—Did you bring the key?
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
—Do you pay rent for this tower?
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
—After all, Haines began...
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
—Italian? Haines said.
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?
—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
—Yes.
—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
—Is she up the pole?
—Better ask Seymour that.
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
—Redheaded women buck like goats.
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless
—Are you going in here, Malachi?
—Yes. Make room in the bed.
—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
—Good, Stephen said.

## 02 — Nestor
<a id="chapter-02"></a>

—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
—Tarentum, sir.
—Very good. Well?
—There was a battle, sir.
—Very good. Where?
—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
—Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?
—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
—Tell us a story, sir.
—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.
—Go on then, Talbot.
—And the story, sir?
—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.
—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
—Half day, sir. Thursday.
—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
—O, ask me, sir.
—A hard one, sir.
—This is the riddle, Stephen said:
—What, sir?
—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.
—What is it, sir? We give it up.
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
—Hockey!
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
—No, sir.
—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
—Yes, sir.
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
—Yes, sir.
—Sargent!
—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
—What is the matter? What is it now?
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhere
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’t
—Iago, Stephen murmured.
—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He
—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
—Alas, Stephen said.
—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about the
—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
—Who has not? Stephen said.
—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
—That is God.
—What? Mr Deasy asked.
—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
—Well, sir, he began.
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
—A learner rather, Stephen said.
—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
—As regards these, he began.
—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
—Mr Dedalus!
—Just one moment.
—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he

—It’s Stephen, sir.
—Let him in. Let Stephen in.
—We thought you were someone else.
—Morrow, nephew.
—Yes, sir?
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
—Bathing Crissie, sir.
—No, uncle Richie...
—Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
—Uncle Richie, really...
—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
—He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.
—Mother dying come home father.

—Mkgnao!
—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
—Milk for the pussens, he said.
—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
—I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
—You don’t want anything for breakfast?
—Mn.
—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.
—Good day to you.
—Lovely weather, sir.
—’Tis all that.
—Now, my miss, he said.
—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
—Threepence, please.
—Thank you, sir. Another time.
—Good morning, he said, moving away.
—Good morning, sir.
—Poldy!
—Who are the letters for?
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And
—Do you want the blind up?
—That do? he asked, turning.
—She got the things, she said.
—Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.
—The kettle is boiling, he said.
—Poldy!
—What?
—Scald the teapot.
—What a time you were! she said.
—Who was the letter from? he asked.
—O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.
—What are you singing?
—_Là ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.
—Would you like the window open a little?
—What time is the funeral?
—Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.
—No: that book.
—It must have fell down, she said.
—Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to
—Met him what? he asked.
—Here, she said. What does that mean?
—Metempsychosis?
—Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That

—Did you finish it? he asked.
—Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the

—Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body

—There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.
—Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I’m ready.
—Come, come, pussy. Come.

## 05 — Lotus-Eaters
<a id="chapter-05"></a>

—Are there any letters for me? he asked.
—Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
—Hello, M’Coy. Nowhere in particular.
—How’s the body?
—Fine. How are you?
—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.
—Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you’re...
—O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
—To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard
—I know.
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
—_Why?_ I said. _What’s wrong with him?_ I said.
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
—_What’s wrong with him_? He said. _He’s dead_, he said. And, faith, he
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
—One of the best, M’Coy said.
—Wife well, I suppose? M’Coy’s changed voice said.
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
—My missus has just got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet.
—My wife too, he said. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the
—That so? M’Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up?
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
—O, well, he said. That’s good news.
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
—Tell you what, M’Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That’ll be all right.
—Right, M’Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
—O God, our refuge and our strength...
—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our

—Come on, Simon.
—After you, Mr Bloom said.
—Yes, yes.
—Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
—That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
—Who is that?
—Your son and heir.
—Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
—Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!
—No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a

—Are we late? Mr Power asked.
—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do
—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.
—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
—And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.
—What’s wrong?
—We’re stopped.
—Where are we?
—The grand canal, he said.
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.
—We’re off again.
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking

—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
—In the paper this morning.
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
—How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
—Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good

—Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the

—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
—Four bootlaces for a penny.
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
—The devil break the hasp of your back!
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
—Well, nearly all of us.
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and
—About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
—Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?
—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
—What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
—Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
—Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
—Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.
—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.
—No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
—Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
—What’s wrong now?
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.
—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the

—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
—Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more decent
—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
—How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
—That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of the

—What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the

—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
—How many children did he leave?
—Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t
—Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?
—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
—And how is Dick, the solid man?
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is

—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.

—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. But
—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretched
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can

—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more

—It does, Mr Bloom said.
—Everything went off A1, he said. What?
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I

—Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.

—O, excuse me!
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.
—Let us, Mr Power said.
—Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
—Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was

—Hello, Flynn.
—How’s things?
—Tiptop... Let me see. I’ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.

—Yes, sir.

—Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
—Yes, sir.

—Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?

—He’s in the craft, he said.
—Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He’s

—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
—Certainly, sir.

—Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
—Is it Zinfandel?

—And your other eye!

—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.

—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.
—Tiptop.
—Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the

—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?

—No. He was not.
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?
—Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your

—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.

—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.

—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.

—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.

—Go on, Simon.
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.

—Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.

—O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,

—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
—What was that, Joe? says I.
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to

—What’s yours? says Joe.
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how’s the old heart, citizen? says
—Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?

—Are you codding? says I.
—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?
—I don’t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
—With Dignam, says Alf.
—Is it Paddy? says Joe.
—Yes, says Alf. Why?
—Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe.
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
—Ay, says Joe.
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
—Who’s dead? says Bob Doran.
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray
—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who’s talking about...?
—Dead! says Alf. He’s no more dead than you are.
—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning
—Paddy? says Alf.
—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
—Good Christ! says Alf.
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.

—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.

—Could you make a hole in another pint?
—Could a swim duck? says I.

—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
—That’s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
—No, says Joe.
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
—Who? Blazes? says Joe.
—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up

—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?
—Half one, says Ned.
—Were you round at the court? says Joe.
—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.
—Hope so, says Ned.
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.

—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.

—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be

—Good health, Ned, says J. J.

—Where? says Alf.
—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
—Remanded, says J. J.
—Who tried the case? says Joe.
—Recorder, says Ned.
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?
—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
—Rely on me, says Joe.
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We
—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just that
—Consider that done, says Joe.
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.
—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.
—Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
—Give us a squint at her, says I.
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
—There’s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?
—It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!

—They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin
—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
—_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_

—Gold cup, says he.
—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
—And Bass’s mare? says Terry.
—Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_
—Not there, my child, says he.
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for the

—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland

—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with

—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you
—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.

—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox
—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.
—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
—Yes, sir, says he. I will.
—You? says Joe.
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
—Yes, says Bloom.
—What is it? says John Wyse.
—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m
—Or also living in different places.
—That covers my case, says Joe.
—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.

—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and
—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.
—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
—But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not
—What? says Alf.
—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
—Well, says John Wyse. Isn’t that what we’re told. Love your neighbour.
—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.
—What’s that? says Joe.
—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that
—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land
—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
—No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
—Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the
—Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.
—Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
—Who? says I.
—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
—There you are, says Terry.
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare
—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
—That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
—Who made those allegations? says Alf.
—I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like
—Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
—Who is Junius? says J. J.
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints
—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that
—Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J. J.
—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.
—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Virag
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my
—Amen, says the citizen.
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.
—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._
—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._

—And so say all of us, says Jack.
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.
—Beg your pardon, says he.
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It’s a
—Bye bye all, says Martin.
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.
—Let me alone, says he.
—Three cheers for Israel!
—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And
—He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.
—Whose God? says the citizen.
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.
—Where is he till I murder him?
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?
—After him, Garry! After him, boy!

—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
—Night!
—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’

—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one
—He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it
—Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep
—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
—A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not
—To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
—Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name
—And what might your name be?
—Dedalus.
—You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
—Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.
—Pom! he then shouted once.
—Pom! he shouted twice.
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.
—Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
—That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s
—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
—Thank you, the sailor said.
—We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,

—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.

—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying

—See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
—And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.
—Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time
